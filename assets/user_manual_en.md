## Main Flows

### Create a New Log

1. Go to **File > New** and select:
	- **New Operation Log**: For regular operations.
	- **New Contest Log**: For contest participation.

2. **Options when creating an operation log:**
	- Define the main callsign for operation.
	- Select the type of operation (CPS, RENER, BULLETIN).
	- Choose the frequency band and mode (HF, VHF, LSB, USB, FM, etc.).
	- Enter the frequency and, if applicable, the repeater.
	- The application automatically generates the log file and associates it with the session.

3. **Options when creating a contest log:**
	- Define the main callsign for operation.
	- Select the contest you are participating in (from a predefined list).
	- The log is associated with the contest name and the corresponding file is generated.

4. Once the log is created, the main window will display the header with the selected data and you can start registering contacts.

### Register a Contact in the Log
1. Enter the callsign in the "Enter callsign" field. If the callsign exists in the database, the associated data is auto-completed and a summary is shown instead of suggestions.
2. Complete the required fields in the form (station, energy, power, RS RX/TX, observations, etc. depending on the log type).
3. Click **Add Contact**. The system validates the data and checks for duplicates. If the contact already exists in the time block (for contests), confirmation is requested.
4. If the callsign is not in the database, you are offered to add it via a dialog. If accepted, the operator is registered and then the contact.
5. The contact is added to the log and the table is updated automatically. The callsign field is cleared for the next entry.

### Delete a Contact from the Log
1. Select the contact you want to delete in the log contacts table by selecting the corresponding row to enable the delete button.
2. Click the **Delete Contact** button.
3. The system will ask for confirmation before deleting the contact.
4. Once confirmed, the contact will be deleted from the log and the table will be updated automatically.

### How Suggestions Work
- As you type in the callsign field, suggestions of operators matching the input (minimum 2 characters) appear next to it.
- Suggestions show the callsign and operator name when hovering over them.
- You can click a suggestion to auto-complete the callsign field and load the associated data.

### How the Waiting Queue Works
- You can add callsigns to the waiting queue using the corresponding button or from the input field.
- The queue shows callsigns pending registration.
- Clicking a callsign in the queue auto-completes the input field to facilitate registration.
- You can remove callsigns from the queue using the context menu (right-click on the callsign and select "Delete").
- The system prevents duplicates in the queue and shows a message if you try to add the same callsign twice.

### Open an Existing Log
1. Go to **File > Open** and select **Open Operation Log** or **Open Contest Log**.
2. Choose the log file you want to open.

### Export Logs and Database
- To export a log: **File > Export > [Format]** (TXT, CSV, ADI, PDF). After exporting, the folder will open and the exported file will be selected automatically, regardless of your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux). If your system does not support file selection, the folder will simply open as a fallback.
- To export the database: **Database > Export to CSV**.

	- The filter is dynamic and shows the number of results found.
	- The filter text is automatically normalized to uppercase for easier searching.
4. Below the filter, you will find a series of checkboxes for each column in the table.
	- You can show or hide columns by toggling the corresponding checkboxes.
	- The visible columns configuration is saved automatically and persists in future sessions.
5. You can adjust the column widths by dragging the edges in the table header.
	- The configured widths are saved automatically.
